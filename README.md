## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

In this project we created a table spreadsheet that will also us to see the monthly budget for the employees in the business. The spreadsheet takes each employee Annual Salary and divides it by 12. Once we have calculated how much each employees salary costs the company monthly, we add it into a table that calculates the monthly total for all employees. Next we have a built in function that if the employees monthly salary exceeds 20,000 dollars the table turns a red color. We can add any new employees to the table and help caluclate thier salaries into the monthly budget as well. The table can help you keep track on how much employees cost the company monthly and if the employees on staff are already over budget. If they are over budget then we can pause the hire of new employees, or calculate raises for employees who might be making too much or too little.
